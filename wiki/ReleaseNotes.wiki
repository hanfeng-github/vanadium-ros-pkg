#summary Release Notes for vanadium_drivers stack

= Vanadium Drivers - 0.2.0 =

=== Stable Components ===
This release includes a number of stable, or mostly stable, components of the arbotix package: 
 * arbotix-ros.py node is ROS API stable, including servo parameter specification, digital/analog services, and the controller loading interface.
 * joint_controller.py controller is stable.
 * base_controller.py/nuke_controller.py are ROS API stable (cmd_vel, odometry publication), however, the parameter specifications and underlying code are subject to change. base_controller PID parameters are currently configurable only via firmware recompile -- this will be fixed in the next release. 

=== Experimental Components ===
 * The Poor Man's Lidar, or PML, (found in arbotix_sensors/pml.py) is experimental. It will be undergoing massive revisions to parameter specifications and data generation in 0.3.0
 * The Controller GUI tool is approaching stability.
