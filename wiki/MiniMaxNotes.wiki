#summary Build, Installation, and Usage info on Mini Maxwell

= Introduction =
Mini Max is a custom mobile manipulator, leveraging the !ArbotiX2, Dynamixel Servos, ROS, and an iRobot Create. The platform is open source.

== Using Mini Maxwell ==
Has been moved to [http://www.ros.org/wiki/mini_max/Tutorials Mini Maxwell Tutorials] on the ROS wiki. 

== Software Roadmap ==
The following need to be addressed:
 * mini_max_core
   * modified version of turtlebot create/gryo drivers (Note: turtlebot drivers are currently not playing well with arbotix drivers, causes both to lock up)
 * mini_max_defs 
   * ~~create URDF -- base, arm, head, gripper. STL files: body, kinect~~
   * ~~arm kinematics launch file~~
 * mini_max_nav
   * launch files for navigation
 * mini_max_apps
   * tuck_arm

= Documentation Roadmap =
 * How to build, wire robot
   * Installing Power Board
   * Setting servo IDs
   * Assembling the Frame
   * Assembling, Wiring the Arm
   * Attaching the Kinect
   
 * Basic tutorials (on ROS.org):
   * ~~How to setup laptop~~
   * ~~Starting up Mini Maxwell~~
   * ~~Reading the state of the switches~~
   * Moving the base
   * Pointing head
   * Moving the arm
   * Using the gripper

= Hardware Revision History =
Future Work: 
Laser cut, parallel jaw gripper

Revision History:
 * V0.2 Revisions (Siena batch)
   * Add holes for ArbotiX mounting
   * Add right angle connectors on front upright, adjoining side
   * New Kinect mounting pieces
   * Add holes in base for wire pass through
 * V0.3 Revisions (Fergy's)
   * Add base ridge for increased stability of arm
   * Holes in base are now rounded squares (better USB cable access)
 * V0.4 Revisions (HMC?)
   * Move left-most Kinect mount just a bit for better alignment.
