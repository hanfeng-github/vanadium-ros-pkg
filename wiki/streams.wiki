#summary Details of new Analog/Digital streams configurations

= Purpose =
To allow easy configuration of analog/digital IO topics. 

== Requirements ==
 * We should be able to easily stream the value of a particular analog channel to a particular topic name. (Same for digital)
 * We should be able to easily publish the desired value to a topic name and set the value of a digital output on the ArbotiX. 
 * Should be configurable through both YAML at startup, and via service at runtime (for our external sensors/controllers).

== Messages ==
 * For analog, we need uint8 as the only field in the message
 * For digital input (from AVR), again we'll use uint8, but anything > 0 is HIGH
 * For digital output (to AVR), we need uint8 for value and uint8 for direction (which is a bit odd -- but, we need to be able to set pull-up on/off).
 * We need a configuration service:
   * Request: consists of type (ANALOG, DIGITAL_INPUT, DIGITAL_OUTPUT), channel (0-n), and topic name to publish on. 
   * Returns bool as to success. 

== YAML ==
 * We should be able to set something like { "topic name": {Analog, 1} } to stream the value of analog channel 1 to ROS. { "topic name": {DigitalInput, 1} } for digital.
