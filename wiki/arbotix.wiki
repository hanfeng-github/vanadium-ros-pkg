The ArbotiX-ROS driver consists of custom firmware for the ArbotiX RoboController, and an ROS node which interacts over a USB serial connection. The ArbotiX firmware provides:
 * Control of up to 252 Dynamixel servos
 * Control of up to 10 hobby (PWM) servos
 * Access to 8 analog channels
 * Control and access of up to 16 digital channels (multiplexed with the hobby servo channels)
 * Full, tunable PID control of 2 motors.
 * IK-based control of walking robots (this requires a special NUKE-based firmware).

On top of the firmware capabilities, the _arbotix-ros_ node provides high level control of a differential drive or IK-based walking robot, including components necessary for using the ROS navigation stack, such as publishing odometry and tf information.
