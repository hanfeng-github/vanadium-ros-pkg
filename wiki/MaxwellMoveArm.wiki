#summary Details of the simple arm movement system

= Introduction =
The _maxwell_move_arm_ package offers a very simple arm movement system. 

= Getting Started =
You can launch a fake version of Maxwell:
{{{
roslaunch maxwell_defs fake_maxwell.launch
}}}
This will bring up a simulated version of the hardware which can be driven around and viewed inside RVIZ. We can then launch the IK service and move arm service:
{{{
roslaunch maxwell_move_arm move_arm.launch
}}}
This brings up a service: _move_arm/move_ and _move_arm/halt_ which can control the arm using Cartesian poses. 

To move the arm, we use a utility move_arm_test.py:
{{{
rosrun move_arm_test.py x y z wrist_pitch [wrist_roll frame_id]
}}}

= Details =
The request to the move_arm/move service includes a geometry_msgs/PoseStamped and attempts to move the arm such that the gripper_link gets to that pose by doing IK lookup and publishing a trajectory. Since Maxwell only has a 5DOF arm, we do some heuristics to adjust the pose until we get a close fit. If an IK solution is found, the arm trajectory is published and a result of True is returned. Otherwise we return false.
