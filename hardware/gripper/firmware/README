Firmware Installation

  1) Install avr-gcc, avrdude. In Ubuntu, this amounts to:
        sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avrdude
  2) Changed directory into the firmware directory.
  3) Run 'make program' to both compile and download code.
  
 Settings:
 -The makefile is defined for an Mega 328. If you are using
  a different chip, you will have to change the definition
  in (2) places (both compilation target and ISP target).
 -To set a different ID (the default is 8), change line
  40 of ax_device.c to the desired ID.


Interfacing with the gripper

 -The firmware currently does not store persistent settings,
  so the ID must be hardcoded.
